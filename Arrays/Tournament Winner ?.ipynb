    "  compete against each other to solve algorithmic problems as fast as possible.\n",
    "  Teams compete in a round robin, where each team faces off against all other\n",
    "  teams. Only two teams compete against each other at a time, and for each\n",
    "  competition, one team is designated the home team, while the other team is the\n",
    "  away team. In each competition there's always one winner and one loser; there\n",
    "  are no ties. A team receives 3 points if it wins and 0 points if it loses. The\n",
